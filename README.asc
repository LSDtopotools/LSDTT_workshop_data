= Data files for the LSDTopoTools workshop	

This repository contains data files for an [LSDTopoTools] workshop, and also used in the Eroding Landscapes course at the [University of Edinburgh, School of GeoSciences].

The repository contains two DEMs, both from the Whiteadder Water catchement in East Lothian Scotland. These DEMs are
. WAWater.bil A larger catchment containing several smaller subbasins. This data is derived from the Ordinance Survey's 5m data product. 
. WA.bil A small tributary of the Whiteadder Water that the Eroding Landscapes course visits. Derived from NextMap 5m resolution IfSAR. 

In addition, the repository contains parameter files that can be used to run analyses.
